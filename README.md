## Hello, I'm MichaÅ‚ ğŸ‘‹

### I'd like to become an automation tester in the future.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything but right now I'm especially practicing API testing and I'm taking an online course within this area.
- ğŸŒ± I love listening to podcasts connected with programming (for example DevTalk).
- ğŸŒ± My goals for 2021 are: to get the first job as a software tester and to further practice my skills in Java and learn the basics of REST Assured, JMeter and Selenium Webdriver really well.
