## Hello, I'm Michał 👋

### I'd like to become an automation tester in the future.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything 🤣 but right now I'm especially practicing API testing and I'm taking an online course within this area
- 🌱 I love listening to podcasts connected with programming (for example DevTalk)
- 🌱 My goals for 2021 are: to get the first job as a software tester and to further practice my skills in Java and learn basics of Rest assured, JMeter and Selenium realy well
