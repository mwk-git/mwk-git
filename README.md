# About me
Hello! My name is Michał. I am an IT enthusiast and I love to develop my skills and gain new knowledge, especially when it comes to technical aspects related to testing.

I became interested in quality assurance at the beginning of 2021. Since then, I have been striving to improve my skills through testing, self-education and participation in conferences and workshops. I am fond of software exploration and I like it when I can contribute to its quality.

My strengths are perceptiveness, analytical thinking, inquisitiveness and even the smallest details are important to me.
